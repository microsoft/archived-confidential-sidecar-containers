# Encrypted filesystem container example

## Preparation

### Managed identity
The user needs to generate a user-assigned managed idenity which will be attached to the container group so that the containers can have the right access permissions to Azure services and resources. More information about creating identities can be found [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/)

### Encrypted filesystem
The user needs to instantiate an [Azure storage container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-blobs-upload) onto which the encrypted filesystem will be uploaded. The roles *Reader* and *Storage Blob Reader* roles need to be assigned to the user-assigned managed identity.

The script `generatefs/generatefs.sh` creates `encfs.img` with the contents of the `generatefs/filesystem` directory. You may need to adjust the size of the image in the script, as it isn't calculated automatically. 

The script expects a symmetric key stored in binary format `keyfile.bin`. If not passed, the script will generate a new one.

```

The user needs to upload the blob to the previously generated storage container 

`azcopy copy --blob-type=PageBlob ./generatefs/encfs.img 'https://<storage-container-uri>.blob.core.windows.net/private-container/encfs.img?<SAS_token_to_container_with_write_create_read_permissions>`

### Security policy generation
Deploying a confidential container group requires generating a security policy that restricts what containers can run within the container group. There is an az tool available for generation of policies.

`az extension add â€“source https://acccliazext.blob.core.windows.net/confcom/confcom-<latest-version>-py3-none-any.whl -y`

`az confcom acipolicygen -i policy-in.json -s policy-out.json -orp`

The policy-input file includes two entries: (i) encrypted filesystem sidecar container which whitelists the /encfs.sh as entry point command and the environment variable *EncfsSideCarArgs* used by the script, and (ii) an application container which whitelists a while loop command as entry point command. 

### Import encryption key
The user needs to instantiate an Azure Key Vault resource that supports storing keys in an HSM: a [Premium vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) or an [MHSM resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/overview). For the former, the user needs to assign 
the *Vault Crypto Officer* and *Vault Crypto User* roles to the user-assigned managed identity and for the latter, the user needs to assign *Managed HSM Crypto Officer* and *Managed HSM Crypto User* roles for /keys to the user-assigned managed identity.

Once the key vault resource is ready, the user can import `RSA-HSM` or `oct-HSM` keys into it using the `importkey` tool placed under `<parent_repo_dir>/tools/importkey` after updating the `importkeyconfig.json` with the required information as discussed in the tools' readme file. For instance, the hostdata claim value needs to be set to the hash digest of the security policy, which can be obtained by executing the following command:

`go run <parent_dir>/tools/securitypolicydigest/main.go -p <base64-std-encoded-string-of-security-policy>`

Once the `importkeyconfig.json` is updated, execute the following command:

`cd <parent_dir>/tools/importkey`

`go run main.go -c <parent_dir>/examples/encfs/importkeyconfig.json -kh deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef -out`
`go run main.go -c <parent_dir>/examples/encfs/importkeyconfig.json -kp private-key.pem -out`
`go run main.go -c <parent_dir>/examples/encfs/importkeyconfig.json -out`

For `RSA-HSM` keys, the `importkey` (if prompted using the `-out` flag) derives an octet key from the RSA private key. Note that it is safe
to use the private RSA key as entropy for a symmetric key as logn as the RSA key pair is not used for any other cryptographic operation.

## Testing
In our confidential container group example, we will deploy the encrypted filesystem sidecar along with a simple container that runs indefentely. The simple container will have access to the remote filesystem mounted by the sidecar container.

### Deployment
The `aci-arm-template.json` provides an ACI ARM template which can be parametrized using the security policy obtained above, the registry name (and credentials if private), the user-assigned managed identity, and the encrypted filesystem sidecar's *EncfsSideCarArgs* set to the base64-std-encoded-string of the sidecar's runtime attribute specified in the `encfs-sidecar-args.json` 

Once the deployment completes, the user can shell into the applicaiton container and execute the following commands:

```
# ls /mnt/remote/share/
lost+found  test.txt

/ # cat /mnt/remote/share/test.txt 
This is a file inside the filesystem.
```
